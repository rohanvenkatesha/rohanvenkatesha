ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @rohanvenkatesha, and I'm a dedicated individual with a strong background in software development. With over 3.5 years of professional experience, I've had the privilege of working as a software developer at both Infosys Limited and Adetrez Labs. During my tenure at these esteemed companies, I had the opportunity to work on various client projects, honing my skills and contributing to the successful completion of numerous software solutions. Currently, I am gaining valuable experience working with the Bubble.io platform, where I'm collaborating with a client to create an admin console dashboard. This project involves integrating APIs to provide user analytics for a client, Gatherly Social Company. This hands-on experience allows me to apply my theoretical knowledge and develop practical skills in software development. I am also actively seeking opportunities for Summer internships in 2024 in the software development field, as mentioned in my previous introduction.

ðŸ’¼ My professional journey has equipped me with a diverse skill set, which includes expertise in several programming languages and tools, such as Python, C, C++, and PowerShell, and web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I'm well-versed in data manipulation and analysis through libraries like NumPy and pandas, and I have experience in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and computer vision technologies like OpenCV, YOLOv5, and Dark Label. Additionally, I have worked with Flask for web development and have experience with database management systems like Oracle 12c, SQL Server, and MySQL. My proficiency extends to technologies like Oracle Xstore Retail POS, Oracle WebLogic, Git, Visual Studio, Jupyter Notebook, Putty, Google Colab, and various Microsoft Office applications, including Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. Furthermore, I am comfortable working on both Linux and Windows operating systems and possess skills in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere Pro.

ðŸŒ± As I continue my academic journey by pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Western Michigan University, I am eager to apply my industry experience and diverse skill set to create innovative solutions and contribute to the field of technology.
