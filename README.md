👋 Hi, I'm @rohanvenkatesha, and I'm a passionate individual with a keen interest in software development. I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at Western Michigan University, where I'm sharpening my skills and knowledge in the world of technology. My journey in the field of computer science has been exciting, and I'm eager to apply what I've learned to real-world projects.

🌱 In my quest to become a proficient software developer, I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies and methodologies. I'm a firm believer in the idea that the tech world is ever-evolving, and staying up-to-date is essential. Currently, I am gaining valuable experience working with the Bubble.io platform, where I'm collaborating with a client to create an admin console dashboard. This project involves integrating APIs to provide user analytics for a client, Gatherly Social Company. This hands-on experience allows me to apply my theoretical knowledge and develop practical skills in software development.

💞️ I'm actively seeking opportunities for internships in the software development field. I'm enthusiastic about the prospect of working with dynamic teams, tackling challenging problems, and contributing to innovative solutions. If you have an exciting internship opportunity that aligns with my interests and skills, I would love to collaborate and learn from experienced professionals in the industry.
